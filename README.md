# Hexagonal Architecture

**Hexagonal Architecture** aims to isolate the **domain** of the application from external dependencies (such as infrastructure, frameworks, and databases), allowing the system to be more flexible, testable, and maintainable with business logic independent of technologies.

## Layer Structure

### 1. **Domain (`domain`)**
- **Defines the ports (interfaces)** that external layers (such as application and infrastructure) should implement.
- Contains **business rules** and domain models. It does not depend on any external technology.
- **Types of Ports:**
    - **Inbound Ports (Driving Ports):** Interfaces representing use cases.
    - **Outbound Ports (Driven Ports):** Interfaces for interaction with external systems, such as repositories or external services.

### 2. **Application Layer (`application`)**
- **Interacts with the domain** via the **inbound ports** defined in the domain.
- **Orchestrates the use cases** but does not contain business logic.
- **Calls outbound ports** to interact with infrastructure, such as saving data or making calls to external services.

### 3. **Infrastructure Layer (`infrastructure`)**
- **Implements outbound ports** defined by the domain.
- Contains the implementation of **adapters**, such as database repositories, external services, and other dependencies.
- **Does not directly interact with the application layer**, ensuring business logic is independent of external technologies.

## Interaction Flow:
1. The **Application Layer** calls an **inbound port** (use case).
2. The **Domain** executes business logic and interacts with **outbound ports**.
3. The **Infrastructure** layer implements the outbound ports and interacts with external systems (e.g., databases, APIs).

## Benefits:
- **Decoupling**: The domain does not depend on external databases, frameworks, or libraries.
- **Testability**: Business logic can be easily tested in isolation without dependencies on infrastructure.
- **Flexibility**: External technologies (such as databases or frameworks) can be swapped without impacting the core business logic.
